We align the quality of learning opportunities to larger trends and substantial challenges facing society. We pursue technology without losing sight of our humanity. We find inspiration through narrative and dialogue.        Electrifying Society Initiative Featuring the expertise of more than 140 researchers from different disciplines, Concordia is helping to put the brakes on CO2 emissions by using the tenets of electrification to make smarter buildings and more efficient transit systems.
