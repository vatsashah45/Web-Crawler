The President and Vice-Chancellor and the senior leadership team ensure the transparency and accountability of the university administration.       In accordance with the Charter of Concordia University, the university’s highest governing body is the Board of Governors, which has final authority over the affairs of the university.       As set out in the By-Laws of Concordia University, the university’s highest academic governing body is Senate, which derives its authority from the Board of Governors.       The Board and Senate Administration supports the work of the Board of Governors, Senate and their respective standing committees.        Policies adopted by Senate or the Board of Governors, as well as other university-wide policies, are posted on the Official Policies pages.
